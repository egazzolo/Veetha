Your Custom Graphics
Drawing them yourself is great. After drawing:

Scan/photograph them
Save as PNG with transparent background (use a tool like remove.bg)
Put files in your ./assets/ folder
Import in code: <Image source={require('./assets/protein-icon.png')} />

Or trace them as SVG paths (cleaner, scalable) - I can help convert simple shapes to SVG code if you describe/show them.
